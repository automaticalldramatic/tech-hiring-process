Start with introducing yourself. Your name, what role you play in this organisation and how the series of interviews would proceed. You taking the lead to talk and explain things out, puts the other person at ease and also establishes what to expect.

- Ask about their current role, what their interests are, what excites them about what they do and a few other questions from the pool listed below

- Make sure you aren't the one talking the most in this round. You are supposed to ask the right questions to get the person to tell you more comfortably how they are as an engineer.

- Continue with questions from the list below in no particular order. Make sure to keep context and make it more into a conversation.

----

    This list is in no particular order. You can mix and match questions based on how the interview is proceeding.
